# Faculty_MarksReport_Generator
This project addresses the inefficiencies of using separate systems for entering student marks and generating performance statistics. The goal is to create a seamless, full-stack web application where educators can input marks, and instantly retrieve detailed analytics and insights on student performance, all in one place.
